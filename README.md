## Thoughts
Using factory functions and IIFE modules actually felt pretty comfortable. I can see why keeping as many variables off the global namespace as possible makes logical sense when working with larger codebase's.

## Possible Improvements
* I've been reading through a few articles on using the minimax algorithm and may setup an AI bot. Setting up an easy version of the bot should also be pretty straightforward using Math.random.
* As always Iâ€™m not happy with the UI design and may come back and add a little more flair to the form.
